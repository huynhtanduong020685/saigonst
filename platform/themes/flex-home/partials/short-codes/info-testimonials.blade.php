              <p>Enrolling our son to Saigon Star International School is one of the best decisions that we have ever taken. Saigon Star is not only the place where our son learns many new academic things, but he also learns how to socialise, respect, as well as being kind and mindful toward others. The school provides such a warm and comfortable place to learn with kind and professional teachers, tentative and supportive staff, lots of greeneries, wide areas to play in; all of them makes such a perfect place for our son to thrive in. Our son is always happy and excited to go to school, and comes home with a bunch of stories and laughter. For us, that’s all that matters.</p>

              <p>We are so glad to be a part of the Saigon Star family since 2015. Our children are learning many new things at school and we are amazed at their growth every day. This school is also evolving in both its curriculum and environment every year. In particular, the IPC curriculum is an effective learning structure for the children with an excellent range of activities provided in each unit and it also develops their international mindedness. Both of our children love the teachers. They are very loving and friendly in nature and keep us updated in knowing the situation of children at school by daily, close communication. We can understand the learning status of children at school on time. We are looking forward to children’s further growth as a part of Saigon Star.</p>
